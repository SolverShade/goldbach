---Instaling Kotlin on windows--- 
I was able to install kotlin on vsCode by getting the extensions "Kotlin", "KotlinLanuge", and "Code Runner" 
If you want to install on your machine a windows package manager like choclatey and the command "choco install kotlinc" should work

---Note on goldbach.py--- 
this is sample code provided in the project files and not part of our kotlin code.

---Note on documentation--- 
If you can provide class documentation comments and function doc comments.
